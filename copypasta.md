## Cardarinepasta

# **CARDARINE IS CARCINOGENIC**

[studies were halted in Phase II on animals because it caused cancers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24428677/)

[Some of cardarine’s proponents argue that cancer risks have not been proven in humans, but this is only because it was never found safe enough to justify long-term safety studies in humans. In fact, most carcinogenic substances usually don’t cause cancer in these types of animal studies because they are not sensitive enough to pick up compounds that only slightly increase the chance of developing cancer. They are designed to pick up on the worst compounds so we don’t risk the lives of human subjects in early clinical work](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-drugs)

[researchers refer to Cardarine as a failed “exercise mimetic,” because it caused cancer in animal studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5850978/)

[However, cardarine had both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects on inflamed rat brain cells. Some inflammatory substances (like TNF-alpha) were reduced in its presence, but others, such as IL-6, were increased. High IL-6 can cause brain cell damage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19422681/) and [another source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12061506/)

[cardarine caused cell death in liver cells and liver damage (fibrosis) in some mice with liver disease, further underlining the dangers associated with this compound](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361396/)

[In animals, cardarine was not safe to use during pregnancy as high doses over an extended period of time posed risks to fetal development](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bdrb.21052/full)

The FDA and almost every single authority concerning studies  pulled the plug on the studies due to the overwhelming amount of cancer being caused due to cardarine usage.

## The dosages in these studies were NOT higher than those being used in humans. 

Something that many fail to realize is that due to larger surface area to volume ratios, *smaller mammals have higher metabolic rates than humans and will need to be given higher dosages of medications relative to their body weight.*

This is called the **Human Equivalent Dose (HED)**, and it is how researchers equate a drug dosage used in mice to human clinical trials.

In [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804402/), the calculated HED for mice is 12.3 meaning that *all dosages given to mice must be divided by 12.3 to determine the accurate human dosage.*

For our cardarine example, many research trials involved dosages around 3mg/kg/day in mice, and if we extrapolate this to humans without taking into account the HED, we would get dosages of 240mg/day for an 80kg individual. Many people stop here and argue that “I’m only taking 10-20mg, not the 240mg the rats were taking.”

What they fail to do is calculate the HED and divide the mouse dosage by 12.3, so we really get ~20mg/day of the drug, which many people take.

Let’s look at some research:

> “In two abstracts published in The Toxicologist, it was shown that when rats and mice were given the drug for two years, there was a significantly increased risk of developing a range of cancers. These carcinogenicity studies were performed as part of the drug approval process.”

\- https://www.tga.gov.au/book-page/12-cardarine

**L. E. Geiger et al., (2009)**

> “Carcinogenic potential of cardarine (GW501516) was assessed in male and female Han Wistar rats by daily administration of GW501516 for 104 weeks. Male rats were given a daily dose of 0,5,15 or 30 mg/kg/day for first six months and 0, 5, 20 or 40 mg/kg/day for rest of the study. Female rats were given a daily dose of 0, 3, 10 or 20 mg/kg/day for the entire duration of study.”
> ...
“Neoplastic changes were noted in multiple tissues at all dose levels. Increased mortality was noted in female rats at all dose levels and uterine endometrial carcinoma was the major cause of death in female rats.”
>
> In a table, the rats developed cancers in many different body systems in doses as low as 3mg/kg/day.

## Bottom line:   **20mg/day would be the human equivalent dosage known to cause cancer.**

Posts on allometric scaling have been made a few times in the past, however they’re easily forgotten. Only thing I might change is that the HED conversion of AED/12.3 is an approximate conversion for mice, but given the prevalence of rat studies it may be more appropriate to use an AED/6.2. This would make the cancer causing doses seem closer to 40-80mg/day.  

I wouldn’t risk even a quarter of that if that’s a cancer causing dosage, those rats were absolutely tumor ridden at the end.

> **BUT BUT THOSE STUDIES WERE ALL EXTREMELY LONG TERM!!!1!**

They’re supposed to be as it’s clinical testing to assess how safe a compound is for human usage. Nonetheless there have been shorter studies as well.

Pollock et al., 2010 described a gastric tumour mouse model that is dependent on the potent and highly selective PPARδ agonist cardarine (GW501516) following carcinogen administration. The progression of gastric tumorigenesis was rapid as determined by magnetic resonance imaging and resulted in highly metastatic squamous cell carcinomas of the fore-stomach within **two months. **

> Exposure of Apcmin mice to the PPARδ ligand GW501516 resulted in a significant increase in the number and size of intestinal polyps. The most prominent effect was on polyp size; mice treated with the PPARδ activator had a fivefold increase in the number of polyps larger than 2 mm. The results implied PPARδ in the regulation of intestinal adenoma growth. To test the effects of PPARδ activation on polyp growth, Apcmin mice were either given vehicle or 10 mg/kg of GW501516. Treatment was **limited to 6 weeks.**
> 
> The control Apcmin mice developed an average of 30 small intestine polyps and 1.4 colonic polyps. In contrast, GW501516 treatment led to a twofold increase in polyp number in the small intestine, with no change in the large bowel. The authors concluded that PPARδ activation promotes the growth of intestinal adenomas in Apcmin mice.

**Although already debunked in above comment, Doses were also not big, here’s a few more with the dosages used highlighted**

For mice:
Dosages of 10, 30, 60 or 80 mg/kg/day

Neoplastic changes were noted in multiple tissues at **all dose levels**. Neoplasms related to GW501516 identified in this study are as follows:

-	Hepatocellular carcinoma of liver (dose level 30 mg/kg/day);
-	Hepatocellular adenoma of liver (dose level 10 mg/kg/day);
-	Squamous cell carcinoma of stomach at **all doses**; and
-	Combined squamous cell tumours i.e. squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma and keratoacanthoma **at all dose levels.**

## Why 500mg?

[500mg is recommended for your first cycle](https://i.ibb.co/rtWy9NL/IMAGE-2023-06-30-11-13-30.jpg).

500 mg is a low dose. Gains are log-linear up to 600 mg and well beyond. If you're going with 300mg, you're still shutting yourself down—and you're leaving a lot of free gains on the table for nothing. 

There's little to no difference in sides between 300 and 500. There's no difference in shutdown between 300 and 500. 

Some low responders need as much as 250mg just to reach normal levels of Testosterone as addressed by TRT. 

500mg is a low dose in that you can take *well over ten times that amount* without any Ill effects.  500mg is a low dose in that bodybuilders have long started from there and worked up. 500 is low. 750 is intermediate. 1000+ is a little bit more advanced. 

At 300mg, you're putting yourself in the no-man's land just between TRT and a full-on blast where it's difficult to dial in your aromatase inhibitor (AI). Managing your estrogen with an AI is one of the most important things you can learn from your first cycle. This dosage is recently picked up popularity by YouTube and fitness influencers *who have stakes in TRT/HRT clinics that cannot legally prescribe more than 300mg*. 

The r/steroids wiki incorporates thousands of clinical studies and case reports to come to its numbers. Test is a very benign compound. Unlike some of the synthetics, your body immediately recognizes it and knows just what to do. 

Taking a higher dose than it's naturally accustomed to simply results in adaptation to temporarily produce relatively higher levels of aromatase to accommodate for the influx of hormone and attain equilibrium.

The immediate byproduct of that adaptive response—17β-Oestradiol (E2) is highly anabolic, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, important for lipid balance and libido, and essential for normal physiological functioning. No acute toxicity or organ stressors manifest themselves, even at doses hundreds of times that of normal.

Your body knows how to handle testosterone. It's been synthesizing it since before birth. It's essential for normal physiological functioning. The Wiki recommends 500mg on your first cycle for good reason.
